Decision making statements:

    These statements are also called control statements. Based on a condition true or false, we can change the flow of execution. So they are called as Decision Making statements

    There are two decision making statements

    i.if
    ii.switch

        1. if statement
            Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
            let age = 20;
                        
            if (age >= 18) {
            console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
            }              



        2. if...else statement
        Executes one block if the condition is true, another if itâ€™s false.


        Syntax:
            if (condition) {
            // Code if condition is true
            } else {
            // Code if condition is false
            }

        let age = 16;
        
        if (age >= 18) {
        console.log("You can vote.");
        } else {
        console.log("You are too young to vote.");
        }



        3. if...else if...else ladder
        
            Checks multiple conditions.
        
            let score = 75;
            
            if (score >= 90) {
            console.log("Grade: A");
            } else if (score >= 75) {
            console.log("Grade: B");
            } else if (score >= 60) {
            console.log("Grade: C");
            } else {
            console.log("Fail");
            }




    4. switch statement

        Used when you want to compare one value with many possible values.
        
        let day = 3;
        
        switch (day) {
        case 1:
            console.log("Monday");
            break;
        case 2:
            console.log("Tuesday");
            break;
        case 3:
            console.log("Wednesday");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Invalid day");
        }




    5. Ternary Operator (? :)
        A shorthand for if...else.

        let age = 20;
        
        let result = (age >= 18) ? "Adult" : "Minor";
        console.log(result);
        If you'd like, I can also give you practical examples for each one. Let me know!
