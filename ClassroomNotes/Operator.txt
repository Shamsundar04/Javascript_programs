Operator:
    Operator are used to perform operation on operants is called as the operator

    1.Arithmetic operator:
        These operators are used to perform Arithmaric operations between numerical values

        eg: + , - , *, /,%

        let a=10;
        let b=20;
        console.log(a + b);
        console.log(a - b);
        console.log(a / 2);
        console.log(a * b);
        console.log(a % b);
        console.log(2 ** 3);

    2.Logical operator:

        These operator are used to perform logical operation 
        eg: AND(&&), OR(||), NOT(!)

    3.Relational operator:

        compare two values.
        They return a Boolean value (true or false) based on the result of the comparison.

        >	Greater than            	5 > 3	    true
        <	Less than	                5 < 3	    false
        >=	Greater than or equal to	5 >= 5	    true
        <=	Less than or equal to	    3 <= 2	    false
        ==	Equal to (loose equality)	5 == "5"	true
        ===	Equal to (strict equality)	5 === "5"	false
        !=	Not equal to (loose)	    5 != "5"	false
        !==	Not equal to (strict)	    5 !== "5"	true

    4.Assignment operator:

        assignment operator used to assign the value

        Operator	Example	    Meaning
            +=	    x += 5;	    x = x + 5;
            -=	    x -= 3;	    x = x - 3;
            *=	    x *= 2;	    x = x * 2;
            /=	    x /= 4;	    x = x / 4;
            %=	    x %= 3;	    x = x % 3;
            **=	    x **= 2;    x = x ** 2; (Exponent)


    5.Ternary operator:

        The ternary operator in JavaScript is a shortcut for if...else statements. 
        It's used to assign a value or execute code based on a condition.

        Syntax:
        condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;
   
    6.Unary operator:

        These operators uses single operands
        eg.'+' -- it is used to convert any datatype to numbers like +'5' -->5

        increment and decrement :

            we can increment 


            ++ is used for increment (increase value by 1)
            -- is used for decrement (decrease value by 1)
            ++a (pre-increment) it will first increase the value and assigns it
            a++ (post-increment)

    7.Nullish Coalescing Operator

        The ?? operator returns the right-hand side value only if the left-hand side is null or undefined.
